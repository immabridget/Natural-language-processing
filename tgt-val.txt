Good morning ? 
How are you ? 
How are you ? 
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth . And the earth was without form , and void ; and darkness was upon the face of the deep : And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said , Let there be light : and there was light .
And God saw the light , that it was good : and God divided the light from the darkness .
And God called the light Day , and the darkness he called Night . And the evening and the morning were the first day . 
And God said , Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
And God made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament : and it was so .
And God called the firmament Heaven . And the evening and the morning were the second day .
And God said , Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it was so .
And God called the dry land Earth ; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas : and God saw that it was good .
And God said , Let the earth bring forth grass , the herb yielding seed , and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind , whose seed is in itself , upon the earth : and it was so .
And the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
And the evening and the morning were the third day .
And God said , Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for days , and years :
And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth : and it was so .
And God made two great lights ; the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night : he made the stars also .
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth ,
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness : and God saw that it was good .
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day .
And God said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
And God created great whales , and every living creature that move , which the waters brought forth abundantly , after their kind , and every winged fowl after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
And God blessed them , saying , Be fruitful , and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let fowl multiply in the earth .
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day .
And God said , Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beast of the earth after his kind : and it was so .
And God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creeps upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
And God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth .
So God created man in his own image , in the image of God he created him ; male and female created he them .
And God blessed them , and God said unto them , Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth , and subdue it : and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth .
And God said , Behold , I have given you every herb bearing seed , which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for food .
And to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth , wherein there is life , I have given every green herb for meat  and it was so .
And God saw every thing that he had made , and , behold , it was very good . And the evening and the morning were the sixth day .
Thus the heavens and the earth were finished , and all the host of them .
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
And God blessed the seventh day , and sanctified it : because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made .
These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens .
And every plant of the field before it was in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grew : for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth , and there was not a man to till the ground .
But there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden ; and from thence it was parted , and became into four heads .
The name of the first is Pison : that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold ;
And the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onyx stone .
And the name of the second river is Gihon : the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia .
And the name of the third river is Hiddekel : that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria . And the fourth river is Euphrates .
And the LORD God took the man , and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it .
And the LORD God commanded the man , saying , Of every tree of the garden you maye freely eat :
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that you eatest thereof thou shall surely die .
And the LORD God said , it is not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him an help mate for him .
And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air ; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them : and whatsoever Adam called every living creature , that was the name thereof .
And Adam gave names to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for Adam there was not found an help mate for him .
And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam , and he slept : and he took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh instead thereof ;
And the rib , which the LORD God had taken from man , made him a woman , and brought her unto the man .
And Adam said , this is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man .
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made . And he said unto the woman , Yes , has God said , You shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
And the woman said unto the serpent , We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden :
But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , You shall not eat of it , neither shall you touch it , lest you die .
And the serpent said unto the woman , You shall not surely die :
For God do know that in the day you eat thereof , then your eyes shall be opened , and you shall be as gods , knowing good and evil .
And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was pleasant to the eyes , and a tree to be desired to make one wise , she took of the fruit thereof , and did eat , and gave also unto her husband with her ; and he did eat .
And the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were naked ; and they sewed fig leaves together , and made themselves aprons .
And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden .
And the LORD God called unto Adam , and said unto him , Where are you ?
And he said , I heard your voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself .
And he said , Who told you that you was naked ? Has you eaten of the tree , whereof I commanded you that you should not eat ?
And the man said , The woman whom you gave to be with me , she gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
And the LORD God said unto the woman , What is this that you have done ? And the woman said , The serpent beguiled me , and I did eat .
And the LORD God said unto the serpent , Because veou have done this, you are cursed above all cattle , and above every beast of the field ; upon your belly shall you go , and dust shall you eat all the days of thy life :
And I will put enmity between you and the woman , and between your seed and her seed ; it shall bruise your head , and you shall bruise his heel .
Unto the woman he said , I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception ; in sorrow you shall bring forth children ; and your desire shall be to your husband , and he shall rule over you .
And unto Adam he said , Because you have hearkened unto the voice of your wife , and has eaten of the tree , of which I commanded you , saying , You shall not eat of it : cursed is the ground for your sake ; in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your life ;
Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you ; and you shall eat the herb of the field ;
In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread , till you return unto the ground ; for out of it you were taken : for dust you are , and unto dust you shall return .
And Adam called his wife's name Eve ; because she was the mother of all living .
Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins , and clothed them .
And the LORD God said , Behold , the man has become as one of us , to know good and evil : and now , lest he put forth his hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever :
Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden , to till the ground from where he was taken .
So he drove out the man ; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims , and a flaming sword which turned every way , to keep the way of the tree of life . 
Adam made love to his wife Eve , and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain .She said , “ With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man . ” 
Later she gave birth to his brother Abel . Now Abel kept flocks , and Cain worked the soil .
In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord .
And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock . The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering ,   
but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor . So Cain was very angry , and his face was downcast .
Then the Lord said to Cain , “ Why are you angry ? Why is your face downcast ?
If you do what is right, will you not be accepted ? But if you do not do what is right , sin is crouching at your door ; it desires to have you , but you must rule over it . ”
Now Cain said to his brother Abel , “ Let us go out to the field . ” While they were in the field , Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him .
Then the Lord said to Cain , “ Where is your brother Abel ? ” “ I don’t know , ” he replied . “ Am I my brother’s keeper ? ”
The Lord said , “ What have you done? Listen ! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground . 
Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground , which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand .
When you work the ground , it will no longer yield its crops for you . You will be a restless wanderer on the earth . ”
Cain said to the Lord , “ My punishment is more than I can bear .
Today you are driving me from the land , and I will be hidden from your presence ; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth , and whoever finds me will kill me . ”
But the Lord said to him , “ Not so ; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over . ” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him . 
So Cain went out from the Lord’s presence and lived in the land of Nod , east of Eden .
Cain made love to his wife , and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch . Cain was then building a city , and he named it after his son Enoch .
To Enoch was born Irad , and Irad was the father of Mehujael , and Mehujael was the father of Methushael , and Methushael was the father of Lamech .
Lamech married two women , one named Adah and the other Zillah .
Adah gave birth to Jabal ; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock .
His brother’s name was Jubal ; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes . 
Zillah also had a son , Tubal - Cain , who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron . Tubal - Cain’s sister was Naamah .
Lamech said to his wives , “ Adah and Zillah , listen to me ; wives of Lamech , hear my words . I have killed a man for wounding me , a young man for injuring me .
If Cain is avenged seven times , then Lamech seventy-seven times . ”
Adam made love to his wife again , and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth , saying , “ God has granted me another child in place of Abel , since Cain killed him . ” 
Seth also had a son , and he named him Enosh . At that time people began to call on the name of the Lord .
This is the written account of Adam’s family line . When God created mankind , he made them in the likeness of God .
He created them male and female and blessed them.  And he named them “ Mankind ” when they were created .
When Adam had lived 130 years , he had a son in his own likeness , in his own image ; and he named him Seth . 
After Seth was born , Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters . 
Altogether , Adam lived a total of 930 years , and then he died .
When Seth had lived 105 years , he became the father of Enosh . 
After he became the father of Enosh , Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters . 
Altogether , Seth lived a total of 912 years , and then he died .
When Enosh had lived 90 years , he became the father of Kenan . 
After he became the father of Kenan , Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters .
ltogether , Enosh lived a total of 905 years , and then he died .
When Kenan had lived 70 years , he became the father of Mahalalel .
After he became the father of Mahalalel , Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters .
Altogether , Kenan lived a total of 910 years , and then he died .
When Mahalalel had lived 65 years , he became the father of Jared .
After he became the father of Jared , Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters .
Altogether , Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years , and then he died .
When Jared had lived 162 years , he became the father of Enoch .
After he became the father of Enoch , Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters .
Altogether , Jared lived a total of 962 years , and then he died .
When Enoch had lived 65 years , he became the father of Methuselah .
After he became the father of Methuselah , Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters .
Altogether , Enoch lived a total of 365 years .
Enoch walked faithfully with God ; then he was no more , because God took him away .
When Methuselah had lived 187 years , he became the father of Lamech .
After he became the father of Lamech , Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters .
Altogether , Methuselah lived a total of 969 years , and then he died .
When Lamech had lived 182 years , he had a son .
He named him Noah and said , “ He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed . ”
After Noah was born , Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters . 
Altogether , Lamech lived a total of 777 years , and then he died .
After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth.
When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them ,
the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful , and they married any of them they chose .
Then the Lord said , “ My Spirit will not contend with humans forever , for they are mortal ; their days will be a hundred and twenty years . ”
The Nephilim were on the earth in those days — and also afterward — when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them . They were the heroes of old , men of renown .
The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth , and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time .
The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth , and his heart was deeply troubled .
So the Lord said , “ I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created — and with them the animals , the birds and the creatures that move along the ground — for I regret that I have made them . ”
But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord .
This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man , blameless among the people of his time , and he walked faithfully with God .
Noah had three sons : Shem , Ham and Japheth .
Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence .
God saw how corrupt the earth had become , for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways .
So God said to Noah , “ I am going to put an end to all people , for the earth is filled with violence because of them . I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth .
So make yourself an ark of cypress wood ; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out .
This is how you are to build it : The ark is to be three hundred cubits long , fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high .
Make a roof for it , leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around . Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower , middle and upper decks .
I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens , every creature that has the breath of life in it . Everything on earth will perish .
But I will establish my covenant with you,  and you will enter the ark — you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you .
You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures , male and female , to keep them alive with you .
Two of every kind of bird , of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive .
You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them . ”
Noah did everything just as God commanded him .
The Lord then said to Noah , “ Go into the ark , you and your whole family , because I have found you righteous in this generation .
Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal , a male and its mate , and one pair of every kind of unclean animal , a male and its mate ,
and also seven pairs of every kind of bird , male and female , to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth .
Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights , and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made . ”
And Noah did all that the Lord commanded him .
Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth .
And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood .
Pairs of clean and unclean animals , of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground ,
male and female , came to Noah and entered the ark , as God had commanded Noah .
And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth .
In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life , on the seventeenth day of the second month — on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth , and the floodgates of the heavens were opened .
And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights .
On that very day Noah and his sons , Shem , Ham and Japheth , together with his wife and the wives of his three sons , entered the ark .
They had with them every wild animal according to its kind , all livestock according to their kinds , every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind , everything with wings .
Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark .
The animals going in were male and female of every living thing , as God had commanded Noah . Then the Lord shut him in .
For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth , and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth .
The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth , and the ark floated on the surface of the water .
They rose greatly on the earth , and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered .
The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits .
Every living thing that moved on land perished — birds , livestock , wild animals , all the creatures that swarm over the earth , and all mankind .
Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died .
Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out ; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth . Only Noah was left , and those with him in the ark .
The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days .
But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark , and he sent a wind over the earth , and the waters receded .
Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed , and the rain had stopped falling from the sky .
The water receded steadily from the earth . At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down ,
and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat .
The waters continued to recede until the tenth month , and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible .
After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark 
and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth .
Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground .
But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth ; so it returned to Noah in the ark . He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark .
He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark .
When the dove returned to him in the evening , there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf ! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth .
He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again , but this time it did not return to him .
By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year , the water had dried up from the earth . Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry .
By the twenty - seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry .
Then God said to Noah ,
“ Come out of the ark , you and your wife and your sons and their wives .
Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you—the birds , the animals , and all the creatures that move along the ground — so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number on it . ”
So Noah came out , together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives .
All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds — everything that moves on land — came out of the ark , one kind after another .
Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and , taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds , he sacrificed burnt offerings on it .
The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart : “ Never again will I curse the ground because of humans , even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood . And never again will I destroy all living creatures , as I have done .
As long as the earth endures , seedtime and harvest , cold and heat , summer and winter , day and night will never cease . ”
Then God blessed Noah and his sons , saying to them , “ Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth . 
The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth , and on all the birds in the sky , on every creature that moves along the ground , and on all the fish in the sea ; they are given into your hands .
Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you . Just as I gave you the green plants , I now give you everything .
But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it .
And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting . I will demand an accounting from every animal . And from each human being , too , I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being .
Whoever sheds human blood , by humans shall their blood be shed ; for in the image of God has God made mankind .
"As for you , be fruitful and increase in number ; multiply on the earth and increase upon it . ”
Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him : 
“ I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you ,
and with every living creature that was with you — the birds , the livestock and all the wild animals , all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth .
I establish my covenant with you : Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood ; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth . ”
And God said , “ This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you , a covenant for all generations to come : 
I have set my rainbow in the clouds , and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth .
Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds , 
I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind . Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life .
Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds , I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth . ”
So God said to Noah , “ This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth . ”
The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem , Ham and Japheth . ( Ham was the father of Canaan . )
These were the three sons of Noah , and from them came the people who were scattered over the whole earth .
Noah , a man of the soil , proceeded to plant a vineyard .
When he drank some of its wine , he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent . 
Ham , the father of Canaan , saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside . 
But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders ; then they walked in backward and covered their father’s naked body . Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father naked .
When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him , 
he said , “ Cursed be Canaan ! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers . ”
He also said , “ Praise be to the Lord , the God of Shem ! May Canaan be the slave of Shem .
May God extend Japheth’s territory ; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem , and may Canaan be the slave of Japheth . ”
After the flood Noah lived 350 years .
Noah lived a total of 950 years , and then he died .
Paul , a servant of Christ Jesus , called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God — 
the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures
regarding his Son , who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David , 
and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead : Jesus Christ our Lord . 
Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his name’s sake . 
And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ .
To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people : Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you , because your faith is being reported all over the world .
God , whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son , is my witness how constantly I remember you 
in my prayers at all times ; and I pray that now at last by God’s will the way may be opened for me to come to you .
I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong — 
that is , that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith . 
I do not want you to be unaware , brothers and sisters , that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you , just as I have had among the other Gentiles .
I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks , both to the wise and the foolish .
That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome .
For I am not ashamed of the gospel , because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes : first to the Jew , then to the Gentile .
For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last , just as it is written : “ The righteous will live by faith . ”
The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people , who suppress the truth by their wickedness , 
since what may be known about God is plain to them , because God has made it plain to them .
For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen , being understood from what has been made , so that people are without excuse .
For although they knew God , they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him , but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened .
Although they claimed to be wise , they became fools 
and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles .
Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another . 
They exchanged the truth about God for a lie , and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator — who is forever praised . Amen .
Because of this , God gave them over to shameful lusts . Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones . 
In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another . Men committed shameful acts with other men , and received in themselves the due penalty for their error .
Furthermore , just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God , so God gave them over to a depraved mind , so that they do what ought not to be done . 
They have become filled with every kind of wickedness , evil , greed and depravity . They are full of envy , murder , strife , deceit and malice . They are gossips , 
slanderers , God-haters , insolent , arrogant and boastful ; they invent ways of doing evil ; they disobey their parents ; 
they have no understanding , no fidelity , no love , no mercy .
Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death , they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them . 
You , therefore , have no excuse , you who pass judgment on someone else , for at whatever point you judge another , you are condemning yourself , because you who pass judgment do the same things . 
Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth .
So when you , a mere human being , pass judgment on them and yet do the same things , do you think you will escape God’s judgment ?
Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness , forbearance and patience , not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance ?
But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart , you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath , when his righteous judgment will be revealed .
God “ will repay each person according to what they have done . ”
To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory , honor and immortality , he will give eternal life .
But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil , there will be wrath and anger .
There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil : first for the Jew , then for the Gentile ; 
but glory , honor and peace for everyone who does good : first for the Jew , then for the Gentile . 
For God does not show favoritism .
All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law , and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law .
For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight , but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous .
Indeed , when Gentiles , who do not have the law , do by nature things required by the law , they are a law for themselves , even though they do not have the law .
They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts , their consciences also bearing witness , and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them .
This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ , as my gospel declares .
Now you,  if you call yourself a Jew ; if you rely on the law and boast in God ; 
if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law ;
if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind , a light for those who are in the dark , 
an instructor of the foolish , a teacher of little children , because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth .
you , then , who teach others , do you not teach yourself ? You who preach against stealing , do you steal ?
You who say that people should not commit adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who abhor idols , do you rob temples ?
You who boast in the law , do you dishonor God by breaking the law ? 
As it is written : “ God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you . ”
Circumcision has value if you observe the law , but if you break the law , you have become as though you had not been circumcised . 
So then , if those who are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements , will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised ?
The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who , even though you have the written code and circumcision , are a lawbreaker .
A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly , nor is circumcision merely outward and physical .
No , a person is a Jew who is one inwardly ; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart , by the Spirit , not by the written code . Such a person’s praise is not from other people , but from God .
What advantage , then , is there in being a Jew , or what value is there in circumcision ? 
Much in every way ! First of all , the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God .
What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s faithfulness ? 
Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written :
“ So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge . ”
But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly , what shall we say ? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us ? I am using a human argument .
Certainly not ! If that were so , how could God judge the world ? 
Someone might argue , “ If my falsehood enhances God’s truthfulness and so increases his glory , why am I still condemned as a sinner ? ” 
Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say , “ Let us do evil that good may result ” ? Their condemnation is just !
What shall we conclude then ? Do we have any advantage ? Not at all ! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin . 
As it is written : “ There is no one righteous , not even one ;
there is no one who understands ; there is no one who seeks God .
All have turned away , they have together become worthless ; there is no one who does good , not even one . ”
“ Their throats are open graves ; their tongues practice deceit . ” “ The poison of vipers is on their lips . "
“ Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness . ”
“ Their feet are swift to shed blood ;
ruin and misery mark their ways , 
and the way of peace they do not know . ”
“ There is no fear of God before their eyes . ”
Now we know that whatever the law says , it says to those who are under the law , so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God .
Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law ; rather , through the law we become conscious of our sin .
But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known , to which the Law and the Prophets testify .
This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe . There is no difference between Jew and Gentile ,
for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God ,
and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus .
God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement , through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith . He did this to demonstrate his righteousness , because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished .
he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time , so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus .
Where , then , is boasting ? It is excluded . Because of what law ? The law that requires works ? No , because of the law that requires faith .
For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law .
Or is God the God of Jews only ? Is he not the God of Gentiles too ? Yes , of Gentiles too ,
since there is only one God , who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith .
Do we , then , nullify the law by this faith ? Not at all ! Rather , we uphold the law .
What then shall we say that Abraham , our forefather according to the flesh , discovered in this matter ?
If , in fact , Abraham was justified by works , he had something to boast about—but not before God .
What does Scripture say ? “ Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness . ”
Now to the one who works , wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation .
However , to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly , their faith is credited as righteousness .
David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works :
“ Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven , whose sins are covered .
Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them . ”
Is this blessedness only for the circumcised , or also for the uncircumcised ? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness .
Under what circumstances was it credited ? Was it after he was circumcised , or before ? It was not after , but before !
And he received circumcision as a sign , a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised . So then , he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised , in order that righteousness might be credited to them . 
And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised .
It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world , but through the righteousness that comes by faith .
For if those who depend on the law are heirs , faith means nothing and the promise is worthless ,
because the law brings wrath . And where there is no law there is no transgression .
Therefore , the promise comes by faith , so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham . He is the father of us all . 
As it is written : “ I have made you a father of many nations . ” He is our father in the sight of God , in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not .
Against all hope , Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations , just as it had been said to him , “ So shall your offspring be . ”
Without weakening in his faith , he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead . 
Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God , but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God ,
being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised . 
This is why “ it was credited to him as righteousness . ” 
The words “ it was credited to him ” were written not for him alone , 
but also for us , to whom God will credit righteousness — for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead . 
He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification .
Therefore , since we have been justified through faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ ,
through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we boast in the hope of the glory of God . 
Not only so , but we also glory in our sufferings , because we know that suffering produces perseverance ;
perseverance , character ; and character , hope . 
And hope does not put us to shame , because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit , who has been given to us .
You see , at just the right time , when we were still powerless , Christ died for the ungodly . 
Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person , though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die .
But God demonstrates his own love for us in this : While we were still sinners , Christ died for us .
Since we have now been justified by his blood , how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him ! 
For if , while we were God’s enemies , we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son , how much more , having been reconciled , shall we be saved through his life ! 
Not only is this so , but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received reconciliation .
Therefore , just as sin entered the world through one man , and death through sin , and in this way death came to all people , because all sinned —
To be sure , sin was in the world before the law was given , but sin is not charged against anyone’s account where there is no law .
Nevertheless , death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses , even over those who did not sin by breaking a command , as did Adam , who is a pattern of the one to come .
But the gift is not like the trespass . For if the many died by the trespass of the one man , how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , overflow to the many !
Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man’s sin : The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation , but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification .
For if , by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man , how much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man , Jesus Christ !
Consequently , just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people , so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people .
For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous .
The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase . But where sin increased , grace increased all the more ,
so that , just as sin reigned in death , so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
What shall we say , then ? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase ?
By no means ! We are those who have died to sin ; how can we live in it any longer ?
Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ? 
We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that , just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , we too may live a new life .
For if we have been united with him in a death like his , we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his .
For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with , that we should no longer be slaves to sin .
because anyone who has died has been set free from sin .
Now if we died with Christ , we believe that we will also live with him .
For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead , he cannot die again ; death no longer has mastery over him . 
The death he died , he died to sin once for all ; but the life he lives , he lives to God .
In the same way , count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus . 
Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires . 
Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness , but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life ; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness .
For sin shall no longer be your master , because you are not under the law , but under grace .
What then ? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace ? By no means ! 
Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves , you are slaves of the one you obey — whether you are slaves to sin , which leads to death , or to obedience , which leads to righteousness ?
But thanks be to God that , though you used to be slaves to sin , you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance . 
You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness .
I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations . Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness , so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness . 
When you were slaves to sin , you were free from the control of righteousness . 
What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of ? Those things result in death !
But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God , the benefit you reap leads to holiness , and the result is eternal life .
For the wages of sin is death , but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord .
Do you not know , brothers and sisters — for I am speaking to those who know the law — that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives ?
For example , by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive , but if her husband dies , she is released from the law that binds her to him . 
So then , if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive , she is called an adulteress . But if her husband dies , she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man .
So , my brothers and sisters , you also died to the law through the body of Christ , that you might belong to another , to him who was raised from the dead , in order that we might bear fruit for God . 
For when we were in the realm of the flesh , the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us , so that we bore fruit for death . 
But now , by dying to what once bound us , we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit , and not in the old way of the written code .
What shall we say , then ? Is the law sinful ? Certainly not! Nevertheless , I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law . For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said , “ You shall not covet . ”
But sin , seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment , produced in me every kind of coveting . For apart from the law , sin was dead . 
Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came , sin sprang to life and I died . 
I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death .
For sin , seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment , deceived me , and through the commandment put me to death . 
So then , the law is holy , and the commandment is holy , righteous and good .
Did that which is good , then , become death to me ? By no means ! Nevertheless , in order that sin might be recognized as sin , it used what is good to bring about my death , so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful .
We know that the law is spiritual ; but I am unspiritual , sold as a slave to sin . 
I do not understand what I do . For what I want to do I do not do , but what I hate I do . 
And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good . 
As it is , it is no longer I myself who do it , but it is sin living in me . 
For I know that good itself does not dwell in me , that is , in my sinful nature . For I have the desire to do what is good , but I cannot carry it out .
For I do not do the good I want to do , but the evil I do not want to do — this I keep on doing . 
Now if I do what I do not want to do , it is no longer I who do it , but it is sin living in me that does it .
So I find this law at work : Although I want to do good , evil is right there with me . 
For in my inner being I delight in God’s law ; 
but I see another law at work in me , waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me .
What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death ? 
Thanks be to God , who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord ! So then , I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law , but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin .
Therefore , there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus ,
because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death .
For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh , God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering . And so he condemned sin in the flesh ,
in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us , who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit .
Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires ; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires . 
The mind governed by the flesh is death , but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace . 
The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God ; it does not submit to God’s law , nor can it do so . 
Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God .
You , however , are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit , if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you . And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ , they do not belong to Christ .
But if Christ is in you , then even though your body is subject to death because of sin , the Spirit gives life because of righteousness . 
And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you , he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you .
Therefore , brothers and sisters , we have an obligation—but it is not to the flesh , to live according to it . 
For if you live according to the flesh , you will die ; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body , you will live .
For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God . 
The Spirit you received does not make you slaves , so that you live in fear again ; rather , the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship . And by him we cry , “ Abba , Father . ” 
The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children .
Now if we are children , then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ , if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory .
consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us .
For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed . 
For the creation was subjected to frustration , not by its own choice , but by the will of the one who subjected it , in hope 
that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God .
We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time .
Not only so , but we ourselves , who have the firstfruits of the Spirit , groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship , the redemption of our bodies .
For in this hope we were saved . But hope that is seen is no hope at all . Who hopes for what they already have ? 
But if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently .
In the same way , the Spirit helps us in our weakness . We do not know what we ought to pray for , but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans . 
And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit , because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God .
And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him , who have been called according to his purpose . 
For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters . 
And those he predestined , he also called ; those he called , he also justified ; those he justified , he also glorified .
What , then , shall we say in response to these things ? If God is for us , who can be against us ? 
He who did not spare his own Son , but gave him up for us all—how will he not also , along with him , graciously give us all things ?
Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen ? It is God who justifies .
Who then is the one who condemns ? No one . Christ Jesus who died—more than that , who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us .
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword ? 
As it is written : “ For your sake we face death all day long ; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered . ”
No , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us .
For I am convinced that neither death nor life , neither angels nor demons , neither the present nor the future , nor any powers , 
neither height nor depth , nor anything else in all creation , will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
I speak the truth in Christ — I am not lying , my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit — 
I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart . 
For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people , those of my own race ,
the people of Israel . Theirs is the adoption to sonship ; theirs the divine glory , the covenants , the receiving of the law , the temple worship and the promises . 
Theirs are the patriarchs , and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah , who is God over all , forever praised ! Amen .
It is not as though God’s word had failed . For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel .
Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children . On the contrary , “ It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned . ”
In other words , it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children , but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring . 
For this was how the promise was stated : “ At the appointed time I will return , and Sarah will have a son . ”
Not only that , but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac .
Yet , before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad — in order that God’s purpose in election might stand :
not by works but by him who calls—she was told , “ The older will serve the younger . ”
Just as it is written : “ Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated . ”
What then shall we say ? Is God unjust ? Not at all !
For he says to Moses , “ I will have mercy on whom I have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion . ”
It does not , therefore , depend on human desire or effort , but on God’s mercy .
For Scripture says to Pharaoh : “ I raised you up for this very purpose , that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth . ”
Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy , and he hardens whom he wants to harden .
One of you will say to me : “ Then why does God still blame us ? For who is able to resist his will ? ” 
But who are you , a human being , to talk back to God ? “ Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it , ‘ Why did you make me like this ? ’ ”
Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use ?
What if God , although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known  , bore with great patience the objects of his wrath — prepared for destruction ? 
What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy , whom he prepared in advance for glory — 
even us , whom he also called , not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles ? 
As he says in Hosea : “ I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people ; and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one , ”
and , “ In the very place where it was said to them , ‘You are not my people , ’ there they will be called ‘children of the living God . ’ ”
Isaiah cries out concerning Israel : “ Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea , only the remnant will be saved .
For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality . ”
It is just as Isaiah said previously : “ Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants , we would have become like Sodom , we would have been like Gomorrah . ”
What then shall we say ? That the Gentiles , who did not pursue righteousness , have obtained it , a righteousness that is by faith ;
but the people of Israel , who pursued the law as the way of righteousness , have not attained their goal . 
Why not ? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works . They stumbled over the stumbling stone . 
As it is written : “ See , I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall , and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame . ”
Brothers and sisters , my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved . 
For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God , but their zeal is not based on knowledge . 
Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own , they did not submit to God’s righteousness . 
Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes .
Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law : “ The person who does these things will live by them . ”
But the righteousness that is by faith says : “ Do not say in your heart , ‘ Who will ascend into heaven ? ’ ” (that is , to bring Christ down ) 
“ or ‘ Who will descend into the deep ? ’ ” (that is , to bring Christ up from the dead) .
But what does it say ? “ The word is near you ; it is in your mouth and in your heart , ” that is , the message concerning faith that we proclaim :
If you declare with your mouth , “ Jesus is Lord , ” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified , and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved .
As Scripture says , “ Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame . ”
For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him , 
for , “ Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved . ”
How , then , can they call on the one they have not believed in ? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard ? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them ? 
And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written : “ How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news ! ”
But not all the Israelites accepted the good news . For Isaiah says , “ Lord , who has believed our message ? ”
Consequently , faith comes from hearing the message , and the message is heard through the word about Christ . 
But I ask : Did they not hear ? Of course they did : “ Their voice has gone out into all the earth , their words to the ends of the world  . 
” Again I ask : Did Israel not understand ? First , Moses says , “ I will make you envious by those who are not a nation ; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding . ”
And Isaiah boldly says , “ I was found by those who did not seek me ; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me . ”
But concerning Israel he says , “ All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people . ”
I ask then : Did God reject his people ? By no means ! I am an Israelite myself , a descendant of Abraham , from the tribe of Benjamin . 
God did not reject his people , whom he foreknew . Don’t you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah — how he appealed to God against Israel :
“ Lord , they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars ; I am the only one left , and they are trying to kill me ” ?
And what was God’s answer to him ?  “ I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal . ”
So too , at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace . 
And if by grace , then it cannot be based on works ; if it were , grace would no longer be grace .
What then ? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain . The elect among them did , but the others were hardened ,
as it is written : “ God gave them a spirit of stupor , eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear , to this very day . ”
And David says : “ May their table become a snare and a trap , a stumbling block and a retribution for them .
May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see , and their backs be bent forever . ”
Again I ask : Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery ? Not at all ! Rather , because of their transgression , salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious .
But if their transgression means riches for the world , and their loss means riches for the Gentiles , how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring !
I am talking to you Gentiles . In as much as I am the apostle to the Gentiles , I take pride in my ministry
in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them . 
For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world , what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ? 
If the part of the dough offered as first fruits is holy , then the whole batch is holy ; if the root is holy , so are the branches .
If some of the branches have been broken off , and you , though a wild olive shoot , have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root , 
do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches . If you do , consider this: You do not support the root , but the root supports you . 
You will say then , “ Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in . ” 
Granted . But they were broken off because of unbelief , and you stand by faith . Do not be arrogant , but tremble . 
For if God did not spare the natural branches , he will not spare you either .
Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God : sternness to those who fell , but kindness to you , provided that you continue in his kindness . Otherwise , you also will be cut off .
And if they do not persist in unbelief , they will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again . 
After all , if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature , and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree , how much more readily will these , the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree !
I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery , brothers and sisters , so that you may not be conceited : Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in , 
and in this way all Israel will be saved . As it is written : “ The deliverer will come from Zion ; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob .
And this is[f] my covenant with them when I take away their sins . ”
As far as the gospel is concerned , they are enemies for your sake ; but as far as election is concerned , they are loved on account of the patriarchs ,
for God’s gifts and his call are irrevocable .
Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience , 
so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now[h] receive mercy as a result of God’s mercy to you . 
For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all .
Oh , the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! How unsearchable his judgments , and his paths beyond tracing out !
“ Who has known the mind of the Lord ? Or who has been his counselor ? ”
“ Who has ever given to God , that God should repay them ? ”
For from him and through him and for him are all things . To him be the glory forever ! Amen .
Therefore , I urge you , brothers and sisters , in view of God’s mercy , to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice , holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship . 
Do not conform to the pattern of this world , but be transformed by the renewing of your mind . Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is — his good , pleasing and perfect will .
For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought , but rather think of yourself with sober judgment , in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you .
For just as each of us has one body with many members , and these members do not all have the same function , 
so in Christ we , though many , form one body , and each member belongs to all the others .
We have different gifts , according to the grace given to each of us . If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith ;
if it is serving , then serve; if it is teaching , then teach ; 
if it is to encourage , then give encouragement ; if it is giving , then give generously ; if it is to lead , do it diligently ; if it is to show mercy , do it cheerfully . 
Love must be sincere . Hate what is evil ; cling to what is good . 
Be devoted to one another in love . Honor one another above yourselves .
Never be lacking in zeal , but keep your spiritual fervor , serving the Lord .
Be joyful in hope , patient in affliction , faithful in prayer . 
Share with the Lord’s people who are in need . Practice hospitality .
Bless those who persecute you ; bless and do not curse . 
Rejoice with those who rejoice ; mourn with those who mourn . 
Live in harmony with one another . Do not be proud , but be willing to associate with people of low position . Do not be conceited .
Do not repay anyone evil for evil . Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone . 
If it is possible , as far as it depends on you , live at peace with everyone . 
Do not take revenge , my dear friends , but leave room for God’s wrath , for it is written : “ It is mine to avenge ; I will repay , ” says the Lord . 
On the contrary : “ If your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him something to drink . In doing this , you will heap burning coals on his head . ”
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good .
Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities , for there is no authority except that which God has established . The authorities that exist have been established by God . 
Consequently , whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted , and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves .
For rulers hold no terror for those who do right , but for those who do wrong . Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority ? Then do what is right and you will be commended .
For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good . But if you do wrong , be afraid , for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason . They are God’s servants , agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer . 
Therefore , it is necessary to submit to the authorities , not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience .
This is also why you pay taxes , for the authorities are God’s servants , who give their full time to governing . 
Give to everyone what you owe them : If you owe taxes , pay taxes ; if revenue , then revenue ; if respect , then respect ; if honor , then honor .
Let no debt remain outstanding , except the continuing debt to love one another , for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law .
The commandments , “ You shall not commit adultery , ” “ You shall not murder , ” “ You shall not steal , ” “ You shall not covet , ” and whatever other command there may be , are summed up in this one command : “ Love your neighbor as yourself . ”
Love does no harm to a neighbor . Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law .
And do this , understanding the present time : The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber , because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed . 
The night is nearly over ; the day is almost here . So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light .
Let us behave decently , as in the daytime , not in carousing and drunkenness , not in sexual immorality and debauchery , not in dissension and jealousy . 
Rather , clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ , and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh .
Accept the one whose faith is weak , without quarreling over disputable matters .
One person’s faith allows them to eat anything , but another , whose faith is weak , eats only vegetables .
The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not , and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does , for God has accepted them . 
Who are you to judge someone else’s servant ? To their own master , servants stand or fall . And they will stand , for the Lord is able to make them stand .
One person considers one day more sacred than another ; another considers every day alike . Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind . 
Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord . Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord , for they give thanks to God ; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God .
For none of us lives for ourselves alone , and none of us dies for ourselves alone . 
If we live , we live for the Lord; and if we die , we die for the Lord . So , whether we live or die , we belong to the Lord . 
For this very reason , Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living .
You , then, why do you judge your brother or sister ? Or why do you treat them with contempt ? For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat . 
It is written : “ ‘ As surely as I live , ’ says the Lord , ‘ every knee will bow before me ; every tongue will acknowledge God . ’ ”
So then , each of us will give an account of ourselves to God .
Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another . Instead , make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister .
I am convinced , being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is unclean in itself . But if anyone regards something as unclean , then for that person it is unclean .
If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat , you are no longer acting in love . Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died .
Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil . 
For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking , but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit , 
because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval .
Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification .
Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food . All food is clean , but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble .
It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall .
So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God . Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves . 
But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat , because their eating is not from faith ; and everything that does not come from faith is sin .
We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves .
Each of us should please our neighbors for their good , to build them up .
For even Christ did not please himself but , as it is written : “ The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me . ”
For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us , so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope .
May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had , 
so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
Accept one another , then , just as Christ accepted you , in order to bring praise to God . 
For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of God’s truth , so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed 
and , moreover , that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy . As it is written : “ Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles ; I will sing the praises of your name . ”
Again , it says , “ Rejoice, you Gentiles , with his people . ”
And again , “ Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles ; let all the peoples extol him . ”
And again , Isaiah says , “ The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations ; in him the Gentiles will hope . ”
May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him , so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit .
I myself am convinced , my brothers and sisters , that you yourselves are full of goodness , filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another .
Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again , because of the grace God gave me 
to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles . He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God , so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God , sanctified by the Holy Spirit .
Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God . 
I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done — 
by the power of signs and wonders , through the power of the Spirit of God . So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum , I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ . 
It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known , so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation . 
Rather , as it is written : “ Those who were not told about him will see , and those who have not heard will understand . ”
This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you .
But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions , and since I have been longing for many years to visit you ,
I plan to do so when I go to Spain . I hope to see you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there , after I have enjoyed your company for a while .
Now , however , I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord’s people there .
For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord’s people in Jerusalem . 
They were pleased to do it , and indeed they owe it to them . For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings , they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings . 
So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution , I will go to Spain and visit you on the way . 
I know that when I come to you , I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ .
I urge you , brothers and sisters , by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit , to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me . 
Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the Lord’s people there , 
so that I may come to you with joy , by God’s will , and in your company be refreshed . 
The God of peace be with you all . Amen .
I commend to you our sister Phoebe , a deacon of the church in Cenchreae .
I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of his people and to give her any help she may need from you , for she has been the benefactor of many people , including me .
Greet Priscilla and Aquila , my co-workers in Christ Jesus . 
They risked their lives for me . Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them .
Greet also the church that meets at their house . Greet my dear friend Epenetus , who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia .
Greet Mary , who worked very hard for you .
Greet Andronicus and Junia , my fellow Jews who have been in prison with me . They are outstanding among the apostles , and they were in Christ before I was .
Greet Ampliatus , my dear friend in the Lord . 
Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ , and my dear friend Stachys .
Greet Apelles , whose fidelity to Christ has stood the test . Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus .
Greet Herodion , my fellow Jew . Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord .
Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa , those women who work hard in the Lord . Greet my dear friend Persis , another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord .
Greet Rufus , chosen in the Lord , and his mother , who has been a mother to me , too .
Greet Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermes , Patrobas , Hermas and the other brothers and sisters with them .
Greet Philologus , Julia , Nereus and his sister , and Olympas and all the Lord’s people who are with them .
Greet one another with a holy kiss . All the churches of Christ send greetings .
I urge you , brothers and sisters , to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned . Keep away from them .
For such people are not serving our Lord Christ , but their own appetites . By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people . 
Everyone has heard about your obedience , so I rejoice because of you ; but I want you to be wise about what is good , and innocent about what is evil .
The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
Timothy , my co-worker , sends his greetings to you , as do Lucius , Jason and Sosipater , my fellow Jews .
I , Tertius , who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord .
Gaius , whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy , sends you his greetings . Erastus , who is the city’s director of public works , and our brother Quartus send you their greetings .
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you . Amen .
Now to him who is able to establish you in accordance with my gospel , the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ , in keeping with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past  , 
but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God , so that all the Gentiles might come to the obedience that comes from faith — 
to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ ! Amen .
Paul , called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God , and our brother Sosthenes ,
To the church of God in Corinth , to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people , together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ — their Lord and ours :
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus . 
For in him you have been enriched in every way — with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge — 
God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you .
Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed .
He will also keep you firm to the end , so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ . 
God is faithful , who has called you into fellowship with his Son , Jesus Christ our Lord .
I appeal to you , brothers and sisters , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought .
My brothers and sisters , some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you . 
What I mean is this : One of you says , “ I follow Paul ” ; another , “ I follow Apollos ” ; another , “ I follow Cephas ” ; still another , “ I follow Christ . ”
Is Christ divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Were you baptized in the name of Paul ?
I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius , 
so no one can say that you were baptized in my name . 
Yes , I also baptized the household of Stephanas ; beyond that , I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else .
For Christ did not send me to baptize , but to preach the gospel — not with wisdom and eloquence , lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power .
For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God .
For it is written : “ I will destroy the wisdom of the wise ; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate . ”
Where is the wise person ? Where is the teacher of the law ? Where is the philosopher of this age ? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world ?
For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him , God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe . 
Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom ,
but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles ,
but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God . 
For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom , and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength .
Brothers and sisters , think of what you were when you were called . Not many of you were wise by human standards ; not many were influential ; not many were of noble birth . 
But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise ; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong .
God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things — and the things that are not — to nullify the things that are , 
so that no one may boast before him . 
It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus , who has become for us wisdom from God — that is , our righteousness , holiness and redemption . 
Therefore , as it is written : “ Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord . ”
And so it was with me , brothers and sisters . When I came to you , I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God .
For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified .
I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling .
My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words , but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power , 
so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom , but on God’s power .
We do , however , speak a message of wisdom among the mature , but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age , who are coming to nothing . 
No , we declare God’s wisdom , a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began .
None of the rulers of this age understood it , for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
However , as it is written : “ What no eye has seen , what no ear has heard , and what no human mind has conceived ” — the things God has prepared for those who love him —
these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit . The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God .
For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them ? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God . 
What we have received is not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit who is from God , so that we may understand what God has freely given us .
This is what we speak , not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit , explaining spiritual realities with Spirit - taught words .
The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness , and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit . 
The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things , but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments , 
for , “ Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him ? ” But we have the mind of Christ .
Brothers and sisters , I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly — mere infants in Christ . 
I gave you milk , not solid food , for you were not yet ready for it . Indeed , you are still not ready .
You are still worldly . For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you , are you not worldly ? Are you not acting like mere humans ? 
For when one says , “ I follow Paul , ” and another , “ I follow Apollos , ” are you not mere human beings ? 
What , after all , is Apollos ? And what is Paul? Only servants , through whom you came to believe — as the Lord has assigned to each his task .
I planted the seed , Apollos watered it , but God has been making it grow .
So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything , but only God , who makes things grow .
The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose , and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor . 
For we are co-workers in God’s service ; you are God’s field , God’s building .
By the grace God has given me , I laid a foundation as a wise builder , and someone else is building on it . But each one should build with care . 
For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid , which is Jesus Christ . 
If anyone builds on this foundation using gold , silver , costly stones , wood , hay or straw , 
their work will be shown for what it is , because the Day will bring it to light . It will be revealed with fire , and the fire will test the quality of each person’s work .
If what has been built survives , the builder will receive a reward . 
If it is burned up , the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved — even though only as one escaping through the flames .
Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst ? 
If anyone destroys God’s temple , God will destroy that person ; for God’s temple is sacred , and you together are that temple .
Do not deceive yourselves . If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age , you should become “ fools ” so that you may become wise . 
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight . As it is written : “ He catches the wise in their craftiness ” ; 
and again , “ The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile . ”
So then , no more boasting about human leaders ! All things are yours ,
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future — all are yours , 
and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.
This , then , is how you ought to regard us : as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the mysteries God has revealed . 
Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful .
I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court ; indeed , I do not even judge myself .
My conscience is clear , but that does not make me innocent . It is the Lord who judges me . 
Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time ; wait until the Lord comes . He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart . At that time each will receive their praise from God .
Now , brothers and sisters , I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit , so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying , “ Do not go beyond what is written . ” Then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other . 
For who makes you different from anyone else ? What do you have that you did not receive ? And if you did receive it , why do you boast as though you did not ?
Already you have all you want ! Already you have become rich ! You have begun to reign — and that without us ! How I wish that you really had begun to reign so that we also might reign with you ! 
For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession , like those condemned to die in the arena . We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe , to angels as well as to human beings .
We are fools for Christ , but you are so wise in Christ ! We are weak, but you are strong ! You are honored , we are dishonored !
To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty , we are in rags , we are brutally treated , we are homeless .
We work hard with our own hands . When we are cursed , we bless ; when we are persecuted , we endure it ; 
when we are slandered , we answer kindly . We have become the scum of the earth , the garbage of the world — right up to this moment .
I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children .
Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ , you do not have many fathers , for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel .
Therefore I urge you to imitate me . 
For this reason I have sent to you Timothy , my son whom I love , who is faithful in the Lord . He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus , which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church .
Some of you have become arrogant , as if I were not coming to you .
But I will come to you very soon , if the Lord is willing , and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking , but what power they have .
For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power . 
What do you prefer ? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline , or shall I come in love and with a gentle spirit ?
It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you , and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate : A man is sleeping with his father’s wife . 
And you are proud ! Shouldn’t you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this ?
For my part , even though I am not physically present , I am with you in spirit . As one who is present with you in this way , I have already passed judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this .
So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit , and the power of our Lord Jesus is present , 
hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord .
Your boasting is not good . Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough ?
Get rid of the old yeast , so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you really are . For Christ , our Passover lamb , has been sacrificed . 
Therefore let us keep the Festival , not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people — 
not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral , or the greedy and swindlers , or idolaters . In that case you would have to leave this world . 
But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy , an idolater or slanderer , a drunkard or swindler . Do not even eat with such people .
What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church ? Are you not to judge those inside ? 
God will judge those outside . “ Expel the wicked person from among you . ”
If any of you has a dispute with another , do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord’s people ? 
Or do you not know that the Lord’s people will judge the world ? And if you are to judge the world , are you not competent to judge trivial cases ?
Do you not know that we will judge angels ? How much more the things of this life !
Therefore , if you have disputes about such matters , do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church ?
I say this to shame you . Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers ? 
But instead , one brother takes another to court — and this in front of unbelievers !
The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be cheated ?
Instead , you yourselves cheat and do wrong , and you do this to your brothers and sisters .
Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God ? Do not be deceived : Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men
nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God .
And that is what some of you were . But you were washed , you were sanctified , you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God .
“ I have the right to do anything , ” you say—but not everything is beneficial . “ I have the right to do anything ” — but I will not be mastered by anything .
You say , “ Food for the stomach and the stomach for food , and God will destroy them both . ” The body , however , is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord , and the Lord for the body .
By his power God raised the Lord from the dead , and he will raise us also .
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute ? Never ! 
Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body ? For it is said , “ The two will become one flesh . ”
But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit .
Flee from sexual immorality . All other sins a person commits are outside the body , but whoever sins sexually , sins against their own body .
Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit , who is in you , whom you have received from God ? You are not your own ; 
you were bought at a price . Therefore honor God with your bodies .
Now for the matters you wrote about : “ It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman . ”
But since sexual immorality is occurring , each man should have sexual relations with his own wife , and each woman with her own husband .
The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife , and likewise the wife to her husband .
The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband . In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife .
Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time , so that you may devote yourselves to prayer . Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control .
I say this as a concession , not as a command . 
I wish that all of you were as I am . But each of you has your own gift from God ; one has this gift , another has that .
Now to the unmarried and the widows I say : It is good for them to stay unmarried , as I do . 
But if they cannot control themselves , they should marry , for it is better to marry than to burn with passion .
To the married I give this command ( not I , but the Lord ) : A wife must not separate from her husband . 
But if she does , she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband . And a husband must not divorce his wife .
To the rest I say this (I , not the Lord) : If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him , he must not divorce her .
And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her , she must not divorce him . 
For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife , and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband . Otherwise your children would be unclean , but as it is , they are holy .
But if the unbeliever leaves , let it be so . The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances ; God has called us to live in peace . 
How do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or , how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ?
Nevertheless , each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the Lord has assigned to them , just as God has called them . This is the rule I lay down in all the churches .
Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised . Was a man uncircumcised when he was called ? He should not be circumcised .
Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing . Keeping God’s commands is what counts . 
Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them .
Were you a slave when you were called ? Don’t let it trouble you — although if you can gain your freedom , do so .
For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord’s freed person ; similarly , the one who was free when called is Christ’s slave .
You were bought at a price ; do not become slaves of human beings . 
Brothers and sisters , each person , as responsible to God , should remain in the situation they were in when God called them .
Now about virgins : I have no command from the Lord , but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy . 
Because of the present crisis , I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is .
Are you pledged to a woman ? Do not seek to be released . Are you free from such a commitment ? Do not look for a wife . 
But if you do marry , you have not sinned ; and if a virgin marries , she has not sinned . But those who marry will face many troubles in this life , and I want to spare you this .
What I mean , brothers and sisters , is that the time is short . From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not ; 
those who mourn , as if they did not ; those who are happy , as if they were not ; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep ; 
those who use the things of the world , as if not engrossed in them . For this world in its present form is passing away .
I would like you to be free from concern . An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord’s affairs — how he can please the Lord .
But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world — how he can please his wife — 
and his interests are divided . An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord’s affairs : Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit . But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world — how she can please her husband . 
I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you , but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord .
If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to , and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to marry , he should do as he wants . He is not sinning . They should get married .
But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind , who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will , and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin — this man also does the right thing . 
So then , he who marries the virgin does right , but he who does not marry her does better .
A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free to marry anyone she wishes , but he must belong to the Lord . 
In my judgment , she is happier if she stays as she is — and I think that I too have the Spirit of God .
Now about food sacrificed to idols : We know that “ We all possess knowledge . ” But knowledge puffs up while love builds up .
Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know .
But whoever loves God is known by God .
So then , about eating food sacrificed to idols : We know that “ An idol is nothing at all in the world ” and that “There is no God but one . ”
For even if there are so-called gods , whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”) , 
yet for us there is but one God , the Father , from whom all things came and for whom we live ; and there is but one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom all things came and through whom we live .
But not everyone possesses this knowledge . Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god , and since their conscience is weak , it is defiled . 
But food does not bring us near to God ; we are no worse if we do not eat , and no better if we do .
Be careful , however , that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak .
For if someone with a weak conscience sees you , with all your knowledge , eating in an idol’s temple , won’t that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols ?
So this weak brother or sister , for whom Christ died , is destroyed by your knowledge .
When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience , you sin against Christ . 
Therefore , if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin , I will never eat meat again , so that I will not cause them to fall .
Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord ? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord ? 
Even though I may not be an apostle to others , surely I am to you ! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord .
This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me .
Don’t we have the right to food and drink ?
Don’t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us , as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas ? 
Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living ?
Who serves as a soldier at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its grapes ? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk ? 
Do I say this merely on human authority ? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing ?
For it is written in the Law of Moses : “ Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain . ” Is it about oxen that God is concerned ? 
Surely he says this for us , doesn’t he ? Yes , this was written for us , because whoever plows and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest .
If we have sown spiritual seed among you , is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you ?
If others have this right of support from you , shouldn’t we have it all the more ? But we did not use this right . On the contrary , we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ .
Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple , and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar ? 
In the same way , the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel .
But I have not used any of these rights . And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me , for I would rather die than allow anyone to deprive me of this boast .
For when I preach the gospel , I cannot boast , since I am compelled to preach . Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel !
If I preach voluntarily , I have a reward ; if not voluntarily , I am simply discharging the trust committed to me . 
What then is my reward ? Just this : that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge , and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the gospel .
Though I am free and belong to no one , I have made myself a slave to everyone , to win as many as possible .
To the Jews I became like a Jew , to win the Jews . To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law) , so as to win those under the law .
To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law)  , so as to win those not having the law .
To the weak I became weak , to win the weak . I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some . 
I do all this for the sake of the gospel , that I may share in its blessings .
Do you not know that in a race all the runners run , but only one gets the prize ? Run in such a way as to get the prize .
Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training . They do it to get a crown that will not last , but we do it to get a crown that will last forever .
Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly ; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air .  
No , I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others , I myself will not be disqualified for the prize .
For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact , brothers and sisters , that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea .
They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea .
They all ate the same spiritual food 
and drank the same spiritual drink ; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them , and that rock was Christ . 
Nevertheless , God was not pleased with most of them ; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness .
Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did .
Do not be idolaters , as some of them were ; as it is written : “ The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry . ”
We should not commit sexual immorality , as some of them did—and in one day twenty three thousand of them died .
We should not test Christ , as some of them did — and were killed by snakes . 
And do not grumble , as some of them did — and were killed by the destroying angel .
These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us , on whom the culmination of the ages has come .
So , if you think you are standing firm , be careful that you don’t fall ! 
No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind . And God is faithful ; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear . But when you are tempted , he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it .
Therefore , my dear friends , flee from idolatry .
I speak to sensible people ; judge for yourselves what I say . 
Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ ? 
Because there is one loaf , we , who are many , are one body , for we all share the one loaf .
Consider the people of Israel : Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar ? 
Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything , or that an idol is anything ?
No , but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons , not to God , and I do not want you to be participants with demons .
You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too ; you cannot have a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons . 
Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s jealousy ? Are we stronger than he ?
“ I have the right to do anything , ” you say — but not everything is beneficial . “ I have the right to do anything ” — but not everything is constructive . 
No one should seek their own good , but the good of others .
Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience , 
for , “ The earth is the Lord’s , and everything in it . ”
If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go , eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience . 
But if someone says to you , “ This has been offered in sacrifice , ” then do not eat it , both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience . 
I am referring to the other person’s conscience , not yours . For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience ? 
If I take part in the meal with thankfulness , why am I denounced because of something I thank God for ?
So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do , do it all for the glory of God .
Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews , Greeks or the church of God — 
even as I try to please everyone in every way . For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many , so that they may be saved .
Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ .
I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you .
But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is man , and the head of Christ is God . 
Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head .
But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head — it is the same as having her head shaved . 
For if a woman does not cover her head , she might as well have her hair cut off ; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved , then she should cover her head .
A man ought not to cover his head , since he is the image and glory of God ; but woman is the glory of man .
For man did not come from woman , but woman from man ;
neither was man created for woman, but woman for man .
It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head , because of the angels .
Nevertheless , in the Lord woman is not independent of man , nor is man independent of woman . 
For as woman came from man , so also man is born of woman . But everything comes from God .
Judge for yourselves : Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered ?
Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a disgrace to him ,
but that if a woman has long hair , it is her glory ? For long hair is given to her as a covering . 
If anyone wants to be contentious about this , we have no other practice — nor do the churches of God .
In the following directives I have no praise for you , for your meetings do more harm than good . 
In the first place , I hear that when you come together as a church , there are divisions among you , and to some extent I believe it .
No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval . 
So then , when you come together , it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat ,
for when you are eating , some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result , one person remains hungry and another gets drunk . 
Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in ? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing ? What shall I say to you ? Shall I praise you ? Certainly not in this matter !
For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you : The Lord Jesus , on the night he was betrayed , took bread ,
and when he had given thanks , he broke it and said , “ This is my body , which is for you ; do this in remembrance of me . ”
In the same way , after supper he took the cup , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant in my blood ; do this , whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me . ” 
For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes .
So then , whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord .
Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup . 
For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves . 
That is why many among you are weak and sick , and a number of you have fallen asleep . 
But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves , we would not come under such judgment . 
Nevertheless , when we are judged in this way by the Lord , we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world .
So then , my brothers and sisters , when you gather to eat , you should all eat together . 
Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home , so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment . And when I come I will give further directions .
Now about the gifts of the Spirit , brothers and sisters , I do not want you to be uninformed  . 
You know that when you were pagans , somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols . 
Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says , “ Jesus be cursed , ” and no one can say , “ Jesus is Lord , ” except by the Holy Spirit .
There are different kinds of gifts , but the same Spirit distributes them .
There are different kinds of service , but the same Lord . 
There are different kinds of working , but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work .
Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good . 
To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom , to another a message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit , 
to another faith by the same Spirit , to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit , 
to another miraculous powers , to another prophecy , to another distinguishing between spirits , to another speaking in different kinds of tongues , and to still another the interpretation of tongues .
All these are the work of one and the same Spirit , and he distributes them to each one , just as he determines .
Just as a body , though one , has many parts , but all its many parts form one body , so it is with Christ . 
For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body — whether Jews or Gentiles , slave or free — and we were all given the one Spirit to drink . 
Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many .
Now if the foot should say , “ Because I am not a hand , I do not belong to the body , ” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body .
And if the ear should say , “ Because I am not an eye , I do not belong to the body , ” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body .
If the whole body were an eye , where would the sense of hearing be ? If the whole body were an ear , where would the sense of smell be ? 
But in fact God has placed the parts in the body , every one of them , just as he wanted them to be . 
If they were all one part , where would the body be ? 
As it is , there are many parts , but one body .
The eye cannot say to the hand , “ I don’t need you ! ” And the head cannot say to the feet , “ I don’t need you ! ”
On the contrary , those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable , 
and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor . And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty ,
while our presentable parts need no special treatment . But God has put the body together , giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it , 
so that there should be no division in the body , but that its parts should have equal concern for each other . 
If one part suffers , every part suffers with it ; if one part is honored , every part rejoices with it .
Now you are the body of Christ , and each one of you is a part of it . 
And God has placed in the church first of all apostles , second prophets , third teachers , then miracles , then gifts of healing , of helping , of guidance , and of different kinds of tongues . 
Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Do all work miracles ? 
Do all have gifts of healing ? Do all speak in tongues ? Do all interpret ? 
Now eagerly desire the greater gifts . And yet I will show you the most excellent way .
If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels , but do not have love , I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal . 
If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge , and if I have a faith that can move mountains , but do not have love , I am nothing . 
If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast , but do not have love , I gain nothing .
Love is patient , love is kind . It does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud .
It does not dishonor others , it is not self-seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . 
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . 
It always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres .
Love never fails . But where there are prophecies , they will cease ; where there are tongues , they will be stilled ; where there is knowledge , it will pass away . 
For we know in part and we prophesy in part , 
but when completeness comes , what is in part disappears . 
When I was a child , I talked like a child , I thought like a child , I reasoned like a child . When I became a man , I put the ways of childhood behind me . 
For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror ; then we shall see face to face . Now I know in part ; then I shall know fully , even as I am fully known .
And now these three remain : faith , hope and love . But the greatest of these is love .
Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit , especially prophecy .
For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God . Indeed , no one understands them ; they utter mysteries by the Spirit . 
But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening , encouraging and comfort . 
Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves , but the one who prophesies edifies the church . 
I would like every one of you to speak in tongues , but I would rather have you prophesy . The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues , unless someone interprets , so that the church may be edified .
Now , brothers and sisters , if I come to you and speak in tongues , what good will I be to you , unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction ? 
Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds , such as the pipe or harp , how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes ?
Again , if the trumpet does not sound a clear call , who will get ready for battle ?
So it is with you . Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue , how will anyone know what you are saying ? You will just be speaking into the air . 
Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world , yet none of them is without meaning . 
If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying , I am a foreigner to the speaker , and the speaker is a foreigner to me . 
So it is with you . Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit , try to excel in those that build up the church .
For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say .
For if I pray in a tongue , my spirit prays , but my mind is unfruitful . 
So what shall I do ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will also pray with my understanding ; I will sing with my spirit , but I will also sing with my understanding .
